- Learn advanced AWS security patterns

---

## üõ† Technical Preparation

### What We'll Build:

1. **Patient Management System**

   - Patient record CRUD operations
   - Medical history storage
   - Secure data retrieval

2. **Additional Lambda Functions**

   - User profile management
   - Medical records handler
   - Appointment scheduler

3. **Database Integration**
   - DynamoDB table design
   - Data access patterns
   - Backup and recovery strategies

### Prerequisites to Review:

- DynamoDB basics and best practices
- Lambda function error handling
- Healthcare data compliance (HIPAA basics)
- API design principles

---

## üìö Study Materials (Optional)

### AWS Documentation:

- [DynamoDB Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
- [Lambda Error Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-exceptions.html)
- [API Gateway Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-basic-concept.html)

### Healthcare Compliance:

- HIPAA compliance basics for cloud applications
- Data encryption requirements
- Audit logging best practices

## üîç What We Accomplished Today

### Major Achievements:

‚úÖ **Fixed Authentication Flow** - SECRET_HASH implementation resolved all 502 errors
‚úÖ **Successful Lambda Deployment** - Both functions working with proper environment variables  
‚úÖ **CORS Resolution** - API Gateway properly configured for frontend integration
‚úÖ **Cognito Integration** - Complete user registration flow functional
‚úÖ **Error Debugging** - Systematic approach to troubleshooting serverless issues

### Key Learning Points:

- **SECRET_HASH is mandatory** when Cognito client secret is configured
- **Environment variables** are crucial for Lambda configuration management
- **Systematic debugging** approach saves time and builds understanding
- **Git workflow** importance for tracking changes and progress

## üöÄ Phase 2 Preview

### What's Coming Next:

1. **Database Layer** - DynamoDB integration for patient data
2. **Advanced Authentication** - Role-based access control
3. **File Handling** - Medical document storage with S3
4. **Real-time Features** - WebSocket integration for notifications
5. **Monitoring & Logging** - CloudWatch and X-Ray implementation

### Architecture Evolution:

```
Current: Frontend ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí Cognito
Next:    Frontend ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí DynamoDB + S3 + SQS
```

## üí° Questions to Think About

Before next session, consider:

1. How should we structure patient data for efficient queries?
2. What security measures are needed for medical records?
3. How do we handle file uploads for medical documents?
4. What backup and disaster recovery strategies should we implement?
5. How can we ensure the system meets healthcare compliance requirements?
