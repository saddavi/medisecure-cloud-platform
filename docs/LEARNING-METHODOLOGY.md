# ðŸŽ“ MediSecure Learning Methodology

## **The "What, How, Why" Approach**

For each AWS service we implement, we'll follow this structured learning pattern:

### **WHAT** - Understanding the Service

- **Purpose**: What does this service do?
- **Use Cases**: When would you use it?
- **Healthcare Context**: Why is it perfect for MediSecure?

### **HOW** - Implementation Approach

- **Manual First**: Use AWS Console to understand the interface
- **Code Second**: Implement with CDK for reproducible infrastructure
- **Integration**: Connect with other services

### **WHY** - Engineering Decisions

- **Cost Implications**: How does this affect our $15 budget?
- **Security Considerations**: HIPAA compliance and data protection
- **Scalability**: How will this grow with our platform?

## **Phase 1: Authentication Foundation (Current Phase)**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Learning Objectives**

- Master AWS Cognito for user authentication
- Understand serverless architecture with Lambda
- Learn API design with API Gateway
- Build your first secure endpoint

### ðŸ“‹ **Hands-on Tasks**

1. **Create Cognito User Pool** (Manual + CDK)
2. **Build Lambda Functions** (User registration, login)
3. **Configure API Gateway** (REST endpoints)
4. **Test Integration** (Postman/React frontend)

### ðŸ’¡ **Key Questions to Answer**

- How does Cognito compare to traditional auth systems?
- Why is Lambda perfect for healthcare APIs?
- What makes API Gateway secure for medical data?

## **Daily Learning Structure**

### **Morning (Theory - 30 mins)**

- Read AWS documentation for the service
- Understand the "why" behind the architecture

### **Afternoon (Hands-on - 2 hours)**

- Manual console implementation
- CDK code development
- Testing and validation

### **Evening (Reflection - 15 mins)**

- Document what you learned
- Note cost implications
- Plan next day's work

## **Budget Tracking & Cost Optimization**

We'll monitor costs in real-time and learn optimization techniques:

| Service     | Expected Monthly Cost | Learning Focus               |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Cognito     | $0-2                  | User management fundamentals |
| Lambda      | $0-1                  | Serverless architecture      |
| API Gateway | $0-3                  | API design patterns          |
| RDS         | $3-5                  | Database optimization        |
| S3          | $0-1                  | Storage strategies           |
| IoT Core    | $1-2                  | Real-time data handling      |
| CloudWatch  | $0-1                  | Monitoring best practices    |

**Target**: Stay under $15/month while building production-grade skills
