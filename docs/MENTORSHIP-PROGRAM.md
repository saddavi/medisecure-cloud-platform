## 🎯 **Learning Methodology**

### **1. Explain the "Why"**
Before building anything, I'll explain:
- Why this AWS service exists
- What problem it solves
- How it fits into your architecture
- Real-world use cases

### **2. Show the "How"**  
Step-by-step implementation with:
- Code examples and explanations
- AWS console demonstrations
- Best practices and common pitfalls
- Troubleshooting techniques

### **3. Reinforce the "What"**
After each implementation:
- Review what we built together
- Explain the architectural decisions
- Discuss alternatives and trade-offs
- Connect to industry standards
