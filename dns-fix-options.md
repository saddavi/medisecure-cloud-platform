## üöÄ Quick Fix: Update Namecheap DNS Configuration

### **Current Issue:**

- DNS points to CloudFront ‚úÖ
- But CloudFront needs SSL certificate for custom domains ‚ùå
- Without SSL certificate ‚Üí 403 error

### **Quick Solution:**

Update your Namecheap DNS to use a subdomain redirect

**Option A: CNAME to CloudFront (Keep current, just test direct URL)**
Test this URL directly: https://d1aaifqtlfz7l5.cloudfront.net
(This should work perfectly)

**Option B: Update DNS for different approach**
In Namecheap, you could:

1. Keep the CNAME as is
2. Just use the CloudFront URL directly for now
3. Deploy proper SSL later when needed

### **Working URLs Right Now:**

‚úÖ https://d1aaifqtlfz7l5.cloudfront.net (Production site)
‚ùå https://healthcare.talharesume.com (Needs SSL certificate)

### **For SSL Certificate Solution:**

We need to deploy the custom domain CDK stack which will:

1. Create SSL certificate in AWS Certificate Manager
2. Add DNS validation records
3. Update CloudFront with certificate
4. Enable healthcare.talharesume.com with proper SSL

Would you like to:

1. ‚úÖ Continue with CloudFront direct URL (works now)
2. üîß Deploy full SSL certificate solution (takes ~10-15 minutes)
